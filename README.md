<h1>React Native Twitter Clone</h1>

This project is a practice application that mimics some basic functionalities of Twitter, with the primary goal of learning and practicing routing in React Native using the React Navigation library.

The application consists of three main screens: "Feed," "Notifications," and "Settings." These screens are managed through a bottom tab navigator, which is a common feature in many mobile applications.

- The "Feed" screen is where tweets would be displayed. In a full-featured Twitter application, this is where you would see a list of tweets from the people you follow.

- The "Notifications" screen is where the user's notifications would be displayed. On Twitter, this would include things like mentions, new followers, and retweets.

- The "Settings" screen is where the user could adjust their account and application preferences.

Additionally, this project not only uses routes but also incorporates tabs and other ways to interact with the app's interface. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how to create a dynamic and user-friendly application.

This project is not an exact clone of Twitter, but it provides a solid foundation for understanding how a React Native application can be structured and how to handle navigation between different screens. It is an excellent starting point for anyone wanting to learn more about React Native and React Navigation.
